## Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Ensure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster. For local development, you can use [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
- **kubectl**: Install the Kubernetes command-line tool [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed to build your container image.
- **Note**: Make sure Your Docker Desktop is running Before your try the below steps.
  
## Dockerizing the React App
Open your react project folder 
1. **Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your React app:**

   ```dockerfile
   # Use the official Node.js image as the base image
   FROM node:16 as build

   # Set the working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application code
   COPY . .

   # Build the React application
   RUN npm run build

   # Use Nginx to serve the app
   FROM nginx:alpine
   COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

   # Expose port 80
   EXPOSE 80

   # Start Nginx
   CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/react-app:v1 .
   ```

3. **Push the image to Docker Hub:**

   ```bash
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/react-app:v1
   ```

## Creating a Kubernetes Deployment

1. **Create a Deployment YAML file (e.g., `deployment.yaml`):**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: react-app-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1  # Adjust as necessary
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: react-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: react-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: react-app
           image: your-dockerhub-username/react-app:v1
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

2. **Apply the Deployment:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

## Creating a Kubernetes Service

1. **Create a Service YAML file (e.g., `service.yaml`):**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: react-app-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     selector:
       app: react-app
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 80
   ```

2. **Apply the Service:**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

## Checking LoadBalancer Status

1. **Check the status of the service:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get services
   ```

   - Wait for the `EXTERNAL-IP` to be assigned (if using a cloud provider) or run `minikube tunnel` if you're on Minikube.

## Accessing the App

1. **Once you have the `EXTERNAL-IP`, open it in your browser:**

   ```
   http://<EXTERNAL-IP>
   ```

   - Alternatively, if you are using Minikube, access it at:

   ```
   http://<minikube_ip>:<nodePort>
   ```

## Scaling the Application

1. **To scale your application:**

   Update the `replicas` field in your `deployment.yaml` file or run:

   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment react-app-deployment --replicas=3
   ```

2. **Verify the number of pods:**

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

## Conclusion

You have successfully deployed your React application on Kubernetes! You can manage and scale your application as needed using Kubernetesâ€™ powerful orchestration capabilities. For more advanced features, consider exploring Kubernetes concepts like **ConfigMaps**, **Secrets**, and **Ingress Controllers**.
